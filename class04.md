. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
- It is a component that renders form elements and controls them by keeping the form data in the components state.

. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
- we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them because the continuous loop of controlled components makes it possible to perform continuous validation on inouts as the user types.

. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
- A handler attached to an input event will be fired on every keystroke.



. Why would we use a ternary operator?
- Using ternary operators we can next test multiple conditions.

Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

let outcome = ((x === y) ? 'true' : 'false');
console.log(outcome);
