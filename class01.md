## Class 01 Reading Notes

. What is a Component?
- A component is a software object, intended to interact with other components, encapsulating certain functionality or a set of functionalities. It has an obviously defined interface and conforms to a recommended behavior common to all components within an architecture.


. What are the characteristics of a component?
1. Resuability - Components are typically designed to be resued however some components may be designed to do a specific task.
2. Replaceable - Components can be substituted with other similar components.
3. Not Context Specific - Components can be used in different environments and contexts.
4. Extensible- Component can be extended from an existing component to provide new behavior.
5. Encapsulated- A component allows users to use its functionality without exposing details of the internal process or any internal variable state.
5. Independent- Components are designed to have minimal dependencies on other components.

. What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?
1. Ease of deployment
2. Reduced Cost
3. Ease of development
4. Resuable
5. Modification of technical complexity
6. Reliability
7. System maintenance and evolution
8. Independent


## Props

. What is “props” short for?
- Props is short for passing data from one component to another.

. How are props used in React?
- Props are being passed to components like function arguments.
- Props can only be passed to components in one way, from parent to child.
- Props data is read-only.

## Things I want to know more about
