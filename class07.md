# How I explained REST to my brother

. Who is Roy Fielding?
- A computer scientist and a principal author of HTTP protocol.

. Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world?
- they weren't designed to be used like that. When Fielding and his colleagues started building the web, being able to talk to any machine anywhere in the world was a primary concern. But most of the techniques developers later used to get computers to talk to each other didn't have those requirements. You just needed to talk to a small group of machines.

. What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created?
- HTTP protocol is when you go to a page, the browser does an HTTP GET o the url you typed  in and back comes a webpage.

. What does a GET do?
- GET is used to request data from a resourse.

. What does a POST do?
- POST are used to send data to the API server.or to add something to another system.

. What does PUT do?
- PUT is used for an update.

. What does PATCH do?
- PATCH is used to replace something completely.
