# Dunder Methods
  - In Python, special methods are a set of predefined methods you can use to enrich your classes. They are easy to recognize because they start and end with double underscores, for example __init__ or __str__.

  Dunder methods let you emulate the behavior of built-in types. For example, to get the length of a string you can call len('string'). But an empty class definition doesnâ€™t support this behavior out of the box.

# Iterators
- An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.

An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.

Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods __iter__() and __next__().

# Generators
- There is a lot of work in building an iterator in Python. We have to implement a class with __iter__() and __next__() method, keep track of internal states, and raise StopIteration when there are no values to be returned.

This is both lengthy and counterintuitive. Generator comes to the rescue in such situations.

Python generators are a simple way of creating iterators. All the work we mentioned above are automatically handled by generators in Python.

Simply speaking, a generator is a function that returns an object (iterator) which we can iterate over (one value at a time).
