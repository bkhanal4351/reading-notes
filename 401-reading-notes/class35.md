# Whiteboard Advice

Whiteboard-style interviews are ubiquitous in the tech industry. For those who not had the pleasure, whiteboard interviewing is the practice of asking candidates to solve technical questions on a whiteboard, piece of paper, or computer during the interview. This kind of environment can feel like a pressure cooker and cause even the most competent engineer to fall apart.

# 6 tips

1. Take a few minutes
  - wait until the interviewer is done explaining the problem. Ask any clarifying questions, and then tell your interviewer

2. Write down the steps of the solution.
  - Even after you have an idea of how to attack the problem, don’t start writing code down. Write down the general steps of how you will solve it on one side of the whiteboard, where it’s visible but won’t get in the way. You don’t need to be verbose, just get the steps in order and somewhat readable.

Start at middle of array.
Keep variables tracking left and right boundaries of search area.
If value equal to search_val, return true.
If left and right boundaries are adjacent, return false.
If value bigger than search_val, go halfway towards left boundary, and move the right boundary along with us.
If value smaller than search_val, go halfway towards right boundary, and move the left boundary along with us.


3. Write pseudocode first.

4. Don’t sweat the small stuff.

5. Sit down. Be humble.

6. Come prepared.
