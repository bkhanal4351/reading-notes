## Class 02 Reading Notes

. What types of things can you pass in the props?
- Props allows us to pass values from a parent to a child component.

. What is the big difference between props and state?
- Porps are passed into a component and state is handled inside of that component. State is handled in the component and you can update it inside the component , props are handled outside the component and must be updated outside the component.

. When do we re-render our application?
- When you change the state inside of a component it re-render that application.

. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
- if you need to change something in an application, you need to store that in state.

## Things I want to know more about

Why are props important when it seems like we are still passing the value as function argument? Could we not just use functions instead?
