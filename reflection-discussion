Command Line or terminal by definition is A text-based user interface to the computer.
The command line is a blank line and cursor on the screen, allowing the user to type in instructions for immediate execution.
All major operating systems (Windows, Mac, Unix, Linux, etc.) support command lines that programmers and power users can employ to perform file management operations directly and often more efficiently than by using a graphical user interface (GUI).
After typing a command, it is executed by pressing the Enter key.
